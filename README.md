## Minecraft Pi Edition
Mojang released a version of the Minecraft game for the Rasberry Pi! See the [here](http://pi.minecraft.net)! This repository
will contain examples of programming code which can be used to interact with the Minecraft world.

### Python API Tutorials
The following tutorials are available in this repository for interacting with the Minecraft Pi edition through the Python
API. The Python language comes preinstalled on the Rasberry PI, and due to easy nature of the syntax and indentation
requirements, is a naturally good language to teach Childeren.

- Tutorial 1 is a HelloWorld example for printing text out to the chat window
- Tutorial 2 carves out a cube of earth
- Tutorial 3 creates a square and then deletes it once more in an infinite loop
